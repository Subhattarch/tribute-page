                <ul>
                  <li><B>8 January 1942:</B> Hawking was born in Oxford to Frank and Isobel Eileen Hawking.</li>
                  <li><B>September 1952:</B> Hawkings was admited to St. Albans School.</li>
                  <li><B>1955:</B> 13-year-old Hawking was ill on the day of the scholarship examination and so, his family could not admit him to Wesminster school and sohe remained at Albans School.</li>
                  <li><B>March 1959:</B> Despite his headmaster's advice to wait until the next year, Hawking was awarded a scholarship after taking the examinations that year.</li>
                  <li><B>October 1959:</B> Hawking began his university education at University College, Oxford, at the age of 17. For the first 18 months, he was bored and lonely. he found the academic work <q>ridiculously easy</q>. His physics tutor, Robert Berman, later said, <q>It was only necessary for him to know that something could be done, and he could do it without looking to see how other people did it.</q></li>
                  <li><B>October 1962:</B> Hawking was concerned that he was viewed as a lazy and difficult student. So, when asked at the viva to describe his plans, he said, <q>If you award me a First, I will go to Cambridge. If I receive a Second, I shall stay in Oxford, so I expect you will give me a First.</q> He was held in higher regard than he believed; as Berman commented, the examiners <q>were intelligent enough to realise they were talking to someone far cleverer than most of themselves</q>. After receiving a first-class BA degree in physics and completing a trip to Iran with a friend, he began his graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge that month.</li>
                  <li><B>June 1964:</B> After being diagnosed with motor neurone disease and encouraged by Sciama, Hawking started developing a reputation for brilliance and brashness when he publicly challenged the work of Fred Hoyle and his student Jayant Narlikar at a lecture.</li>
                  <li><B>1965:</B> Inspired by Roger Penrose's theorem of a spacetime singularity in the centre of black holes, Hawking applied the same thinking to the entire universe; and, he wrote his thesis on this topic.</li>
                  <li><B>1966:</B> Hawking's thesis was approved.</li>
                  <li><B>March 1966:</B> Hawking obtained his PhD degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising in general relativity and cosmology, and his essay <q>Singularities and the Geometry of Space-Time</q> shared top honours with one by Penrose to win that year's prestigious Adams Prize.</li>
                  <li><B>1970:</B> Hawking and Penrose published a proof that if the universe obeys the general theory of relativity and fits any of the models of physical cosmology developed by Alexander Friedmann, then it must have begun as a singularity.</li>
                  <li><B>1973:</B> Hawking moved into the study of quantum gravity and quantum mechanics.</li>
                  <li><B>1974:</B> His results, which Hawking presented, showed that black holes emit radiation, known today as Hawking radiation, which may continue until they exhaust their energy and evaporate.</li>
                  <li><B>14 March 2018:</B> Hawking passed away at the age of 76.</li>
